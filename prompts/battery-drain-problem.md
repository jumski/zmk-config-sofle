# Battery Drain Problem

I have a Sofle v2 keyboard with nice nano mcu (bluetooth) and ZMK firmware installed. It works when connected via usb cable and it pairs when using bluetooth, but the right half drains battery like crazy. I want you to help me debug this using my message and materials i gathered:

<problem> 
Right half drains battery like crazy (hours to fully depleted). I replaced the battery to some other compatible one (suspecting its faulty battery) but it was just dead in no time. 
I'm pretty sure the right half drain battery even when the power switch is off and nano is off
battery is drained in around 24h or less. 
it does not show any lightss when switch is off, it is also not visible in bluetooth, so seems like nicenano is not powered
</problem>

for physical switch it is a slide switch solderedd to PCB.
battery is soldered to the PCB but i can desolder it and provide some connection to hook multimeter in series
